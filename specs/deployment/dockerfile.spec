SPECIFICATION: Container Security - Dockerfile Standards
Category: Deployment
Enforcement Level: CRITICAL (BLOCKING)
Version: 2.0
================================================================================

PURPOSE
-------
Ensure all container images follow security best practices.

SCOPE
-----
All Dockerfile definitions for Python applications

================================================================================
APPROVED BASE IMAGES
================================================================================

IMAGE SELECTION STRATEGY:
  🥇 PREFERRED: Hardened images for runtime (maximum security)
  🥈 ALTERNATIVE: UBI images when debugging/package management needed
  🏗️  BUILDER STAGE: Always use UBI (requires package manager)

HARDENED IMAGES (Red Hat Hardened - PREFERRED FOR RUNTIME):
  registry.access.redhat.com/hi/python:latest

CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Distroless-style minimal image
  - NO package manager (no dnf, yum, apt)
  - NO shell (/bin/sh not available)
  - Runs as non-root UID 65532 (hardcoded)
  - Minimal attack surface (smallest possible image)
  - Contains only Python runtime and essential libraries
  - Red Hat security updates and support

WHY HARDENED IMAGES ARE PREFERRED:
  ✅ Maximum security - minimal attack surface
  ✅ No package manager - eliminates entire class of vulnerabilities
  ✅ No shell - prevents shell injection attacks
  ✅ Smallest image size - faster deployments
  ✅ Immutable runtime - no modification possible
  ✅ Compliance ready - meets strictest security standards
  ✅ Production-optimized - designed for runtime only

WHEN TO USE HARDENED IMAGES:
  ✅ ALL production runtime workloads (default choice)
  ✅ Security-sensitive applications
  ✅ Compliance-required environments (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
  ✅ Applications with all dependencies pre-built
  ✅ Stateless microservices

LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS:
  ⚠️  Cannot install packages at runtime (no package manager)
  ⚠️  Cannot use dnf/yum commands in Dockerfile RUN steps
  ⚠️  All dependencies MUST be installed in builder stage
  ⚠️  Debugging requires using ephemeral debug containers
  ⚠️  Fixed UID 65532 (cannot change user)
  ⚠️  No shell - cannot use RUN commands with shell syntax

USAGE PATTERN (Multi-stage build REQUIRED):
  # Stage 1: Builder (use UBI with package manager)
  FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest AS builder
  RUN dnf install -y gcc postgresql-devel && dnf clean all
  # ... build dependencies and virtual environment ...

  # Stage 2: Runtime (PREFERRED - hardened image)
  FROM registry.access.redhat.com/hi/python:latest
  # No RUN commands with package installation
  COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
  # Image already runs as UID 65532 - no USER directive needed
  CMD ["gunicorn", "app:app"]

UNIVERSAL BASE IMAGES (Red Hat UBI - Use for Builder or when hardened not suitable):
  registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest
  registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-39:latest
  registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/python-39:latest

REQUIREMENTS:
  - Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image) - enterprise-grade
  - RHEL-based (security patches from Red Hat)
  - Free to use and redistribute
  - Active Red Hat security support
  - Already runs as non-root (UID 1001)

WHY RED HAT UBI:
  - Enterprise support and SLA
  - Security updates from Red Hat
  - Compliance and certification (FIPS, Common Criteria)
  - Consistent with Red Hat OpenShift environments
  - Built-in security best practices
  - Package manager available (dnf/yum)
  - Shell available for debugging

WHEN TO USE UBI (instead of hardened):
  ✅ Builder stage (ALWAYS - requires package manager)
  ✅ Development/testing environments (easier debugging)
  ✅ When runtime package installation is required
  ✅ Legacy applications not compatible with distroless
  ✅ Troubleshooting production issues (temporary)

DECISION TREE - WHICH IMAGE TO USE:

  Is this a builder stage?
    YES → Use UBI (registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest)

  Is this a runtime stage for production?
    YES → Do you need to install packages at runtime?
      NO  → ✅ Use HARDENED (registry.access.redhat.com/hi/python:latest)
      YES → Use UBI (registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest)

  Is this for development/debugging?
    YES → Use UBI (registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest)

FORBIDDEN:
  ❌ python:latest (unpredictable, breaks reproducibility)
  ❌ python:3.8 or older (EOL, no security patches)
  ❌ python:alpine (compatibility issues with psycopg2, numpy, etc.)
  ❌ ubuntu, debian base images (use Red Hat UBI for enterprise)
  ❌ Custom base images (without security approval)
  ❌ Non-Red Hat images in Red Hat OpenShift environments

================================================================================
MANDATORY DOCKERFILE PATTERNS
================================================================================

REQ-1: MULTI-STAGE BUILDS (REQUIRED)
  Purpose: Minimize final image size, separate build and runtime

  Structure:
    Stage 1: Builder (UBI with package manager)
      - Switch to root (for dnf install)
      - Install build dependencies (gcc, postgresql-devel, python3-devel)
      - Build Python packages
      - Create virtual environment
      - Clean dnf cache

    Stage 2: Runtime (Hardened or UBI)
      - Copy only virtual environment from builder
      - Copy application code
      - Run as non-root user (65532 for hardened, 1001 for UBI)

  Builder Stage Pattern:
    FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-39:latest AS builder

    # UBI images default to non-root - switch to root for system packages
    USER root

    # Install build dependencies
    RUN dnf install -y \
            gcc \
            postgresql-devel \
            python3-devel \
        && dnf clean all \
        && rm -rf /var/cache/dnf

    # Create and use virtual environment
    RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
    ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \
        pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  Why python3-devel is required:
    - Needed to compile Python packages with C extensions
    - Required for packages like psycopg2, numpy, pandas
    - Must be installed in builder (not available in hardened image)

  Why USER root in builder:
    - UBI images default to UID 1001 (non-root)
    - dnf requires root privileges
    - Builder is discarded (never shipped), so root is safe here
    - Final runtime image still runs as non-root

REQ-2: NON-ROOT USER
  Rule: Container MUST run as non-root user (UID 1000+)

  Pattern (Hardened Image):
    # Hardened image runs as UID 65532 by default
    # Explicitly set for clarity (best practice)
    USER 65532

  Pattern (Red Hat UBI):
    # Red Hat UBI images run as UID 1001 by default
    # Explicitly set for clarity
    USER 1001

  Pattern (Generic images - create user):
    # Create user
    RUN groupadd -r appuser && \
        useradd -r -g appuser -u 1000 appuser

    # Switch to non-root
    USER appuser

  Why: Prevents privilege escalation attacks

  File Ownership:
    - Hardened image: Use --chown=65532:0 when copying files
    - UBI image: Use --chown=1001:0 when copying files
    - Group 0 (root group) is required for OpenShift compatibility

REQ-3: NO SECRETS IN LAYERS
  Rule: NO secrets, credentials, keys in any image layer

  Forbidden:
    ❌ ENV DB_PASSWORD=hardcoded
    ❌ COPY credentials.json /app/
    ❌ RUN echo "secret" > /app/config

  Approved: Runtime injection via Kubernetes Secrets

REQ-4: MINIMAL INSTALLED PACKAGES
  Rule: Install only required packages, remove build dependencies

  Pattern (Red Hat UBI - using dnf):
    # Install runtime dependencies
    RUN dnf install -y \
        postgresql \
        && dnf clean all

  Pattern (Debian-based - using apt):
    # Install runtime dependencies
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        libpq5 \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

  Avoid: Build tools (gcc, make) in final image

REQ-5: HEALTH CHECK
  Rule: Define HEALTHCHECK instruction

  Pattern (works in both UBI and hardened images):
    HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
        CMD python -c \
            "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8080/health')" \
            || exit 1

  Why this works in hardened images:
    - Uses Python stdlib (urllib) - no external tools required
    - No shell commands (curl, wget) needed
    - Pure Python execution
    - exit 1 on failure for proper signal

  Alternative (Kubernetes probes - also valid):
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 30

REQ-6: EXPLICIT PORTS
  Rule: EXPOSE ports used by application

  Pattern:
    EXPOSE 8080

  Note: Use port 8080 (not privileged ports like 80) for non-root containers

REQ-7: PRODUCTION SERVER
  Rule: Use production WSGI/ASGI server (NOT Flask dev server)

  Approved:
    - Gunicorn (Flask, Django)
    - Uvicorn (FastAPI, async)
    - uWSGI (Django)

  Pattern (Gunicorn with container logging):
    CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "--workers", "4", \
         "--timeout", "60", "--access-logfile", "-", "--error-logfile", "-", \
         "src.app:app"]

  Why use these flags:
    - --access-logfile "-" : Logs to stdout (container best practice)
    - --error-logfile "-"  : Errors to stderr (container best practice)
    - Enables log aggregation (12-factor app)
    - Works with kubectl logs, OpenShift logging

  Forbidden:
    ❌ flask run (development only)
    ❌ python app.py (development only)
    ❌ Gunicorn without logging flags (logs lost)

================================================================================
CONTAINERFILE HEADER DOCUMENTATION (REQUIRED)
================================================================================

Every Containerfile MUST include a header comment block documenting:
  - Application name
  - Runtime image and its characteristics
  - Builder image and its purpose
  - Reference to this spec

REQUIRED HEADER PATTERN:

# ================================================================================
# <Application Name> — Containerfile
# Runtime: registry.access.redhat.com/hi/python:latest (Hummingbird hardened,
#          Python 3.14, non-root UID 65532, no package manager — distroless-style)
# Builder: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-39:latest (has dnf to compile
#          native extensions; discarded after build — never ships in final image)
# Spec: specs/deployment/dockerfile.spec
# ================================================================================

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  - Documents image choice (why hardened vs UBI)
  - Explains security model (UID 65532, distroless)
  - Clarifies what's in runtime vs builder
  - Links to authoritative spec
  - Helps reviewers understand security posture
  - Self-documenting infrastructure

STAGE SEPARATOR COMMENTS (RECOMMENDED):

# ── Stage 1: Builder (UBI9 — has dnf, gcc, postgresql-devel) ─────────────────
# The builder is never shipped. It exists only to compile native extensions and
# install all Python packages into /opt/venv, which is then copied to runtime.

# ── Stage 2: Runtime (Hardened Image — no package manager, UID 65532) ─────────

BENEFITS:
  - Clear visual separation of stages
  - Explains purpose of each stage
  - Makes Containerfile easier to understand
  - Prevents accidental runtime package installation

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED CONTAINERFILE TEMPLATE (Hardened Runtime - PRODUCTION DEFAULT)
================================================================================

# ================================================================================
# <Application Name> — Containerfile
# Runtime: registry.access.redhat.com/hi/python:latest (Hummingbird hardened,

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-39:latest AS builder

# Switch to root to install system packages (UBI images default to non-root)
USER root

# Install build dependencies — these are NOT in the final image
RUN dnf install -y \
        gcc \
        postgresql-devel \
        python3-devel \
    && dnf clean all \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/dnf

# Create virtual environment at /opt/venv

COPY --chown=65532:0 config/ /app/config/

# Explicitly set the hardened image's non-root user (best practice for clarity)

EXPOSE 8080

# Health check — uses Python stdlib only (no curl/wget in distroless image)
# This WORKS in hardened images when using Python's urllib (no shell required)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \

     "--timeout", "60", "--access-logfile", "-", "--error-logfile", "-", \
     "src.app:app"]

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE DOCKERFILE TEMPLATE (Red Hat UBI - When hardened not suitable)
================================================================================

USE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN:
  - You need to install runtime packages (rare in production)
  - Debugging is needed (development/testing)
  - Legacy application compatibility issues with distroless

# Stage 1: Builder
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest AS builder

# Install build dependencies (using dnf for RHEL)
RUN dnf install -y \
    gcc \
    postgresql-devel \
    && dnf clean all

# Create virtual environment
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Copy and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest

# Install runtime dependencies only (using dnf for RHEL)
RUN dnf install -y \
    postgresql \
    && dnf clean all

# Note: Red Hat UBI Python images already run as non-root user (UID 1001)
# This is a built-in security feature - no need to create user

# Copy virtual environment from builder
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application code (UBI default user is UID 1001, group 0)
COPY --chown=1001:0 src/ /app/src/
COPY --chown=1001:0 config/ /app/config/

# UBI images already run as non-root, explicitly set for clarity
USER 1001

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Health check (works with UBI since shell is available)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')"

# Run with production server
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--workers", "4", "--timeout", "60", "src.app:app"]

================================================================================
HARDENED IMAGE OPERATIONAL GUIDE
================================================================================

DEBUGGING HARDENED IMAGES:
  Since there's no shell, you cannot exec into the container.

  For debugging, use Kubernetes ephemeral debug containers:

    # Attach debug container with tools
    kubectl debug -it <pod-name> --image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal \
      --target=<container-name>

  Or temporarily switch to UBI image for troubleshooting:

    FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-311:latest  # instead of hi/python

KUBERNETES PROBES FOR HARDENED IMAGES:
  Do NOT use HEALTHCHECK instruction (requires shell).
  Use Kubernetes native probes instead:

  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /health
      port: 8000
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 30

  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /health
      port: 8000
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 10

================================================================================
BUILD ARGUMENTS & ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
================================================================================

BUILD ARGUMENTS (ARG):
  Use for build-time configuration only
  Example:
    ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
    FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim-bookworm

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (ENV):
  Avoid for secrets (use runtime injection)
  Acceptable uses:
    - PATH modifications
    - Python settings (PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1)
    - Non-sensitive defaults

  Example:
    ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
        PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
        PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

SECRETS INJECTION:
  Method: Kubernetes Secrets as environment variables
  NOT in Dockerfile: ENV SECRET_KEY=...

================================================================================
OPTIMIZATION BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

LAYER CACHING:
  - Copy requirements.txt first (before app code)
  - Leverage Docker layer caching
  - Rebuild only when dependencies change

REDUCE IMAGE SIZE:
  - Use slim base images
  - Remove build dependencies in final stage
  - Clean apt cache: rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  - Use .dockerignore (exclude tests, docs, .git)

SECURITY:
  - Scan with Trivy, Snyk, or similar
  - Update base images regularly
  - Pin dependency versions
  - Run as non-root

REPRODUCIBILITY:
  - Pin base image version
  - Pin all Python packages (requirements.txt)
  - Document build date/version

================================================================================
.dockerignore FILE (REQUIRED)
================================================================================

Purpose: Exclude unnecessary files from build context

Recommended .dockerignore:

.git
.gitignore
.env
.env.local
*.md
README.md
docs/
tests/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/
.vscode/
.idea/
*.log

Benefits:
  - Faster builds (smaller context)
  - No secrets accidentally copied
  - Smaller final image

================================================================================
SECURITY SCANNING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

TOOL: Trivy (or equivalent)

Scan Command:
  trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL <image-name>

Pass Criteria:
  - Zero HIGH severity vulnerabilities
  - Zero CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities

Failure Action:
  - Block deployment
  - Create security ticket
  - Require remediation

Scan Frequency:
  - Every build (CI/CD)
  - Daily scan of production images
  - Immediate scan after security advisories

================================================================================
KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT INTEGRATION
================================================================================

Security Context (Deployment manifest):
